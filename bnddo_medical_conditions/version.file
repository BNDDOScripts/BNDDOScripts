<0.0.1> 
Medical System - Version 0.0.1
- Modular condition system with support for custom effects like bleeding, poisoning, etc.
- Condition configuration includes damage per tick, temporary or permanent status, screen effects, effect priority, and blocking logic.
- Medical items configurable via item definitions with support for:
  - Treating (temporarily suppressing) conditions
  - Curing (permanently removing) conditions
  - Self-treatment (selfTreat flag)
  - Self-curing (selfCure flag)
  - Doctor-only usage (requiresDoctor flag with requiredJobGrade)
  - Treatment duration with progress bar (treatmentTime)
  - Doctor treatment speed modifier (doctorTreatmentTimeMultiplier)
- Supports using medical items on nearby players or self if allowed by item config.
- Automatically selects closest player within 1.5 units; falls back to self if none are nearby.
- Prevents using items when no matching conditions are found or if config flags block the action.
- Prevents treating and curing the same condition at the same time; will prioritize treatment.
- Validates conditions before applying effects to avoid invalid or ineffective treatments.
- Suppression time system allows for temporary relief from conditions (e.g., bandage stops bleeding for X seconds).
- Supports configuration of preventIf and ignoreIf conditions to block or nullify effects based on other active conditions.
- Uses screenEffect and effectPriority to visually represent active conditions.
- All condition and item logic designed to be modular and easily extendable.
- Clean separation of targeting logic (finding players) and condition logic (treat/cure flow).
- Uses callback-based getClosestPlayer function to support async-friendly proximity checks.
- LocalPlayer.state used for job validation and permission handling.
- Fully readable and maintainable code, designed for expansion (e.g., third-eye targeting, NPC healing).
